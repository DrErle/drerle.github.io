# Mark Erle
I am a Professor of Practice and Associate Chair in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Lehigh University, where I teach and develop courses in systems programming, software engineering, cybersecurity, and student success in computing. My work focuses on helping students build strong technical foundations while developing metacognitive, professional, and lifelong-learning skills.

My technical interests span computer systems, cybersecurity, microprocessor architecture, Linux and PowerShell scripting, and applied AI/ML—especially in how large language models can support software design, development, and debugging. I also mentor students on career development, project-based learning, and effective use of modern tooling such as GitHub, cloud services, and development environments.

Outside the classroom, I enjoy designing infrastructure projects (like high-reliability home servers), planning international travel, and exploring opportunities for teaching and research collaborations in Portugal and Europe.
